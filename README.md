# jcombine

## Introduction
A Python script to combine multiple Java source files into a single file.

## Usage
`python3 jcombine.py source_dir target_file`

**Caution:** A source file with the same name as the target file must be present in the source directory (or its subdirectories).

**Example:** `python3 jcombine.py /home/ramin/project/src /home/ramin/Main.java`

## History
This script was written during the Advanced Programming course I took at [Tehran Polytechnic (AUT)][1],
in order for me and my friends to easily upload a single Java file to [Quera][2], where our exercises where hosted.

## Say Thanks
In case you find this script useful, I would be glad if you could give it a star.
